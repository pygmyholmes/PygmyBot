# PygmyBot
A discord bot made in python, using the discord.py library.

This bot will require you to have ffmpeg installed and added to PATH.
It will also require you to pip install (or whatever else is a python package manager thing) the following python libraries
1. PyNaCl (for voice chat support)
2. discord.py
3. youtube-dl

To run it yourself, you'll need your own discord bot set up in a server, and you'll need to remove the .example from the config.ini.example file, and add in the corresponding bot tokens.
